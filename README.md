# Dark Mode Transitions

Just a quick showcase of how you can use the (very experimental) page transitions api to toggle a sites theme.

> Note: You currently must use chrome canary with the `#document-transitions` flag enabled for this to work.

The code for this demo was largeley inspired by [this demo](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/shared-element-transitions-for-spas/#how-these-transitions-work) for the page transitions api. I then adapted it to do theme changes.
